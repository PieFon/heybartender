# Hey Bartender!
As a former bar patron who now has to make their own drinks, 
I want easy access to a library of cocktail recipes that I know I will enjoy, 
so that I can make my own drinks from home. 

The Hey Bartender web application uses two API's to call cocktail recipes from Cocktail DB, and find user compatibility from the Love Calculator API. Users are able to search by a specific alcohol type, find a list of non-alcoholic drinks or generate a random drink recipe. Using the Love Calculator, a compatibility percentage is also presented to the user based on their name input. Users can also save their favorite drink recipes to a saved drinks page to recall at a later time.
